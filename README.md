# 12-digit-password-generator
The main goal of a password generator is to create unique passwords that are difficult to guess or crack using techniques like brute force or social engineering. A 12-digit password is long enough to enhance security while remaining practical for most use cases.
Generated passwords might look like this: Yp6%~cnTr_Pw. Such a combination of characters makes it highly secure.
